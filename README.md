# Bioinformatics Winter Internship 2017

![Winter Internship 2017](https://github.com/hariesramdhani/winter-internship-2017/blob/master/readme_banner.png)

This repository contains codes that are/were written from my 1st to my 20th day of internship and short explanations of what I did during the internship at Gebze Technical University, supervised by Asst. Prof. Dr. Tunahan Ã‡AKIR from Bioengineering Department.

### Analyses and Reports
Analyses were perfomed in Python and R, depend on the necessities. The final products are in (`.ipynb` extension) jupyter notebook files because this allows me to explain the analyses clearer. All of the analyses can be found in the `~/src` folder and the `.html`/`.pdf` files can be found in the `~/report` folder.

### Final Reports
Final reports are reports that were written at the end of each stage, the first stage was developing the program to retrieve data sets from GEO Database while the second stage is analyzing the RNA-Seq data of Parkinson's disease. Final reports are in the `.docx` (Microsoft Word 2007++) extension.

- [x] Stage 2: Report

### Daily Logs
Daily logs contain summary of what I did each day during the internship, I usually update them every weekend since during weekdays I mostly focused on understanding new things and working on the projects.

### Data Sources
These are the collections of data that are used for the project/analyses, majority of these data are gathered from all over the internet, mostly from big databases. The data are stored in the `~/data` folder.
- [mRNA-Seq expression and MS3 proteomics profiling of human post-mortem BA9 brain tissue for Parkinson's Disease and neurologically normal individuals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68719)
