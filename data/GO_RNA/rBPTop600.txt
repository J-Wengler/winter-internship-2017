GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_RESPONSE_TO_STIMULUS	1929	Any process that activates, maintains or increases the rate of a response to a stimulus. Response to stimulus is a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus.	79	0.0410	1.08E-21	3.24E-18

GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_CELL_COMMUNICATION	1532	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of cell communication. Cell communication is the process that mediates interactions between a cell and its surroundings. Encompasses interactions such as signaling or attachment between one cell and another cell, between a cell and an extracellular matrix, or between a cell and any other aspect of its environment.	65	0.0424	1.06E-18	1.65E-15

GO_INTRACELLULAR_SIGNAL_TRANSDUCTION	1572	The process in which a signal is passed on to downstream components within the cell, which become activated themselves to further propagate the signal and finally trigger a change in the function or state of the cell.	65	0.0413	3.84E-18	2.87E-15
GO_IMMUNE_SYSTEM_PROCESS	1984	Any process involved in the development or functioning of the immune system, an organismal system for calibrated responses to potential internal or invasive threats.	74	0.0373	4.31E-18	2.87E-15
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1733	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	67	0.0387	3.3E-17	1.92E-14
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MOLECULAR_FUNCTION	1791	Any process that activates or increases the rate or extent of a molecular function, an elemental biological activity occurring at the molecular level, such as catalysis or binding.	68	0.0380	4.66E-17	2.41E-14
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MULTICELLULAR_ORGANISMAL_PROCESS	1395	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of an organismal process, any of the processes pertinent to the function of an organism above the cellular level; includes the integrated processes of tissues and organs.	58	0.0416	2.22E-16	1.03E-13
GO_NEGATIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1493	Any process that decreases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	60	0.0402	3.04E-16	1.28E-13
GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_PROLIFERATION	1496	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell proliferation.	60	0.0401	3.32E-16	1.29E-13
GO_NEGATIVE_REGULATION_OF_NITROGEN_COMPOUND_METABOLIC_PROCESS	1517	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of the chemical reactions and pathways involving nitrogen or nitrogenous compounds.	60	0.0396	6.22E-16	2.23E-13
GO_CELLULAR_RESPONSE_TO_ORGANIC_SUBSTANCE	1848	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an organic substance stimulus.	66	0.0357	2.66E-15	8.85E-13
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_INTRACELLULAR_SIGNAL_TRANSDUCTION	876	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of intracellular signal transduction.	43	0.0491	7.77E-15	2.41E-12
