GO_CENTRIOLE	102	A cellular organelle, found close to the nucleus in many eukaryotic cells, consisting of a small cylinder with microtubular walls, 300-500 nm long and 150-250 nm in diameter. It contains nine short, parallel, peripheral microtubular fibrils, each fibril consisting of one complete microtubule fused to two incomplete microtubules. Cells usually have two centrioles, lying at right angles to each other. At division, each pair of centrioles generates another pair and the twin pairs form the pole of the mitotic spindle.	3	0.0294	2.36E-5	1.31E-2
GO_BLOOD_MICROPARTICLE	143	A phospholipid microvesicle that is derived from any of several cell types, such as platelets, blood cells, endothelial cells, or others, and contains membrane receptors as well as other proteins characteristic of the parental cell. Microparticles are heterogeneous in size, and are characterized as microvesicles free of nucleic acids.	3	0.0210	6.45E-5	1.31E-2
GO_MICROTUBULE_ORGANIZING_CENTER_PART	145	Any constituent part of a microtubule organizing center, a region in a eukaryotic cell, such as a centrosome or basal body, from which microtubules grow.	3	0.0207	6.72E-5	1.31E-2
GO_ANCHORING_JUNCTION	489	A cell junction that mechanically attaches a cell (and its cytoskeleton) to neighboring cells or to the extracellular matrix.	4	0.0082	1.34E-4	1.96E-2
GO_MEMBRANE_REGION	1134	A membrane that is a part of a larger membrane.  Examples include the apical region of the plasma membrane of an epithelial cell and the various regions of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.	5	0.0044	3.19E-4	3.33E-2
GO_CELL_JUNCTION	1151	A cellular component that forms a specialized region of connection between two or more cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. At a cell junction, anchoring proteins extend through the plasma membrane to link cytoskeletal proteins in one cell to cytoskeletal proteins in neighboring cells or to proteins in the extracellular matrix.	5	0.0043	3.42E-4	3.33E-2
