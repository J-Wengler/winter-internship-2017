GO_INTRACELLULAR_SIGNAL_TRANSDUCTION	1572	The process in which a signal is passed on to downstream components within the cell, which become activated themselves to further propagate the signal and finally trigger a change in the function or state of the cell.	114	0.0725	6.28E-29	5.85E-26
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_CELL_COMMUNICATION	1532	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of cell communication. Cell communication is the process that mediates interactions between a cell and its surroundings.

GO_REGULATION_OF_INTRACELLULAR_SIGNAL_TRANSDUCTION	1656	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of intracellular signal transduction.	115	0.0694	1.5E-27	6.96E-25
GO_CELLULAR_RESPONSE_TO_ORGANIC_SUBSTANCE	1848	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an organic substance stimulus.	121	0.0655	1.05E-26	4.46E-24
GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_PROLIFERATION	1496	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell proliferation.	106	0.0709	4.09E-26	1.59E-23
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MOLECULAR_FUNCTION	1791	Any process that activates or increases the rate or extent of a molecular function, an elemental biological activity occurring at the molecular level, such as catalysis or binding.	116	0.0648	3.26E-25	1.17E-22
GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_DIFFERENTIATION	1492	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell differentiation, the process in which relatively unspecialized cells acquire specialized structural and functional features.	102	0.0684	5.72E-24	1.79E-21
GO_REGULATION_OF_RESPONSE_TO_STRESS	1468	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of a response to stress. Response to stress is a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a disturbance in organismal or cellular homeostasis, usually, but not necessarily, exogenous (e.g. temperature, humidity, ionizing radiation).	101	0.0688	6.04E-24	1.79E-21
GO_REGULATION_OF_MULTICELLULAR_ORGANISMAL_DEVELOPMENT	1672	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of multicellular organismal development.	109	0.0652	6.17E-24	1.79E-21
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1733	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	111	0.0641	9.36E-24	2.56E-21

GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_DEATH	1472	Any process that modulates the rate or frequency of cell death. Cell death is the specific activation or halting of processes within a cell so that its vital functions markedly cease, rather than simply deteriorating gradually over time, which culminates in cell death.	99	0.0673	9.14E-23	2.13E-20
