GO_MITOCHONDRION	1633	A semiautonomous, self replicating organelle that occurs in varying numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of virtually all eukaryotic cells. It is notably the site of tissue respiration.	32	0.0196	1.78E-7	1.74E-5
GO_PERINUCLEAR_REGION_OF_CYTOPLASM	642	Cytoplasm situated near, or occurring around, the nucleus.	18	0.0280	7.8E-7	6.5E-5
GO_CELL_PROJECTION_PART	946	Any constituent part of a cell projection, a prolongation or process extending from a cell, e.g. a flagellum or axon.	21	0.0222	3.87E-6	2.83E-4
GO_CENTRIOLE	102	A cellular organelle, found close to the nucleus in many eukaryotic cells, consisting of a small cylinder with microtubular walls, 300-500 nm long and 150-250 nm in diameter. It contains nine short, parallel, peripheral microtubular fibrils, each fibril consisting of one complete microtubule fused to two incomplete microtubules. Cells usually have two centrioles, lying at right angles to each other. At division, each pair of centrioles generates another pair and the twin pairs form the pole of the mitotic spindle.	7	0.0686	7.8E-6	5.06E-4
GO_NEURON_PROJECTION	942	A prolongation or process extending from a nerve cell, e.g. an axon or dendrite.	20	0.0212	1.26E-5	7.34E-4
GO_SOMATODENDRITIC_COMPARTMENT	650	The region of a neuron that includes the cell body (cell soma) and the dendrite, but excludes the axon.	16	0.0246	1.61E-5	8.57E-4
GO_DENDRITE	451	A neuron projection that has a short, tapering, often branched, morphology, receives and integrates signals from other neurons or from sensory stimuli, and conducts a nerve impulse towards the axon or the cell body. In most neurons, the impulse is conveyed from dendrites to axon via the cell body, but in some types of unipolar neuron, the impulse does not travel via the cell body.	13	0.0288	2.02E-5	9.81E-4
GO_NEURON_PART	1265	Any constituent part of a neuron, the basic cellular unit of nervous tissue. A typical neuron consists of a cell body (often called the soma), an axon, and dendrites. Their purpose is to receive, conduct, and transmit impulses in the nervous system.	23	0.0182	3.28E-5	1.47E-3
GO_APICAL_PLASMA_MEMBRANE	292	The region of the plasma membrane located at the apical end of the cell.	10	0.0342	4.4E-5	1.84E-3
GO_APICAL_PART_OF_CELL	361	The region of a polarized cell that forms a tip or is distal to a base. For example, in a polarized epithelial cell, the apical region has an exposed surface and lies opposite to the basal lamina that separates the epithelium from other tissue.	11	0.0305	5.31E-5	2.07E-3
GO_MICROTUBULE_ORGANIZING_CENTER_PART	145	Any constituent part of a microtubule organizing center, a region in a eukaryotic cell, such as a centrosome or basal body, from which microtubules grow.	7	0.0483	7.55E-5	2.76E-3
GO_COP9_SIGNALOSOME	34	A protein complex that catalyzes the deneddylation of proteins, including the cullin component of SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase; deneddylation increases the activity of cullin family ubiquitin ligases. The signalosome is involved in many regulatory process, including some which control development, in many species; also regulates photomorphogenesis in plants; in many species its subunits are highly similar to those of the proteasome.	4	0.1176	9.07E-5	3.12E-3
GO_NUCLEOLUS	848	A small, dense body one or more of which are present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus. This association results in the formation of ribonucleoprotein precursors; these pass into the cytoplasm and mature into the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome.	17	0.0200	1.12E-4	3.64E-3
GO_CELL_SURFACE	757	The external part of the cell wall and/or plasma membrane.	15	0.0198	3.18E-4	9.78E-3
GO_BLOOD_MICROPARTICLE	143	A phospholipid microvesicle that is derived from any of several cell types, such as platelets, blood cells, endothelial cells, or others, and contains membrane receptors as well as other proteins characteristic of the parental cell. Microparticles are heterogeneous in size, and are characterized as microvesicles free of nucleic acids.	6	0.0420	5.23E-4	1.47E-2
