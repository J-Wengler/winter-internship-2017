GO_MONOVALENT_INORGANIC_CATION_TRANSMEMBRANE_TRANSPORTER_ACTIVITY	366	Enables the transfer of a inorganic cations with a valency of one from one side of a membrane to the other. Inorganic cations are atoms or small molecules with a positive charge that do not contain carbon in covalent linkage.	13	0.0355	2.17E-6	1.83E-4
GO_PROTEIN_COMPLEX_BINDING	935	Interacting selectively and non-covalently with any protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules).	21	0.0225	3.24E-6	2.51E-4
GO_INORGANIC_CATION_TRANSMEMBRANE_TRANSPORTER_ACTIVITY	527	Enables the transfer of inorganic cations from one side of a membrane to the other. Inorganic cations are atoms or small molecules with a positive charge that do not contain carbon in covalent linkage.	15	0.0285	5.45E-6	3.54E-4
