GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MULTICELLULAR_ORGANISMAL_PROCESS	1395	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of an organismal process, any of the processes pertinent to the function of an organism above the cellular level; includes the integrated processes of tissues and organs.	33	0.0237	1.28E-9	5.23E-7
GO_REGULATION_OF_PROTEIN_MODIFICATION_PROCESS	1710	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of the covalent alteration of one or more amino acid residues within a protein.	37	0.0216	1.34E-9	5.23E-7
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_CYTOKINE_PRODUCTION	370	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of production of a cytokine.	17	0.0459	1.35E-9	5.23E-7
GO_INTRACELLULAR_SIGNAL_TRANSDUCTION	1572	The process in which a signal is passed on to downstream components within the cell, which become activated themselves to further propagate the signal and finally trigger a change in the function or state of the cell.	35	0.0223	1.88E-9	6.39E-7
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1733	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	37	0.0214	1.92E-9	6.39E-7
GO_NEGATIVE_REGULATION_OF_NITROGEN_COMPOUND_METABOLIC_PROCESS	1517	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of the chemical reactions and pathways involving nitrogen or nitrogenous compounds.	34	0.0224	2.75E-9	8.14E-7
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_CATALYTIC_ACTIVITY	1518	Any process that activates or increases the activity of an enzyme.	34	0.0224	2.8E-9	8.14E-7
GO_DEFENSE_RESPONSE	1231	Reactions, triggered in response to the presence of a foreign body or the occurrence of an injury, which result in restriction of damage to the organism attacked or prevention/recovery from the infection caused by the attack.	30	0.0244	3.85E-9	1.05E-6
GO_REGULATION_OF_HYDROLASE_ACTIVITY	1327	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of hydrolase activity, the catalysis of the hydrolysis of various bonds, e.g. C-O, C-N, C-C, phosphoric anhydride bonds, etc. Hydrolase is the systematic name for any enzyme of EC class 3.	31	0.0234	5.58E-9	1.44E-6
GO_CELL_DEATH	1001	Any biological process that results in permanent cessation of all vital functions of a cell. A cell should be considered dead when any one of the following molecular or morphological criteria is met: (1) the cell has lost the integrity of its plasma membrane; (2) the cell, including its nucleus, has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies (frequently referred to as apoptotic bodies). The cell corpse (or its fragments) may be engulfed by an adjacent cell in vivo, but engulfment of whole cells should not be considered a strict criteria to define cell death as, under some circumstances, live engulfed cells can be released from phagosomes (see PMID:18045538).	26	0.0260	1.24E-8	3.04E-6
GO_REGULATION_OF_CYTOKINE_PRODUCTION	563	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate, or extent of production of a cytokine.	19	0.0337	2.2E-8	5.12E-6
