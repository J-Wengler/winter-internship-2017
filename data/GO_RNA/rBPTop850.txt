GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MULTICELLULAR_ORGANISMAL_PROCESS	1395	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of an organismal process, any of the processes pertinent to the function of an organism above the cellular level; includes the integrated processes of tissues and organs.	84	0.0602	1.33E-23	1.23E-20
GO_INTRACELLULAR_SIGNAL_TRANSDUCTION	1572	The process in which a signal is passed on to downstream components within the cell, which become activated themselves to further propagate the signal and finally trigger a change in the function or state of the cell.	89	0.0566	3.73E-23	2.89E-20
GO_IMMUNE_SYSTEM_PROCESS	1984	Any process involved in the development or functioning of the immune system, an organismal system for calibrated responses to potential internal or invasive threats.	101	0.0509	8.97E-23	5.96E-20

GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MOLECULAR_FUNCTION	1791	Any process that activates or increases the rate or extent of a molecular function, an elemental biological activity occurring at the molecular level, such as catalysis or binding.	93	0.0519	1.4E-21	7.25E-19
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1733	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	91	0.0525	1.9E-21	8.82E-19
GO_CELLULAR_RESPONSE_TO_ORGANIC_SUBSTANCE	1848	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an organic substance stimulus.	94	0.0509	3.4E-21	1.44E-18
GO_NEGATIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1493	Any process that decreases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	83	0.0556	3.88E-21	1.51E-18
