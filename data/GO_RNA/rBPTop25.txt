GO_NEGATIVE_REGULATION_OF_PROTEIN_METABOLIC_PROCESS	1087	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of chemical reactions and pathways involving a protein.	6	0.0055	2.08E-5	1.08E-2
GO_NEGATIVE_REGULATION_OF_CELLULAR_COMPONENT_ORGANIZATION	684	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of a process involved in the formation, arrangement of constituent parts, or disassembly of cell structures, including the plasma membrane and any external encapsulating structures such as the cell wall and cell envelope.	5	0.0073	2.99E-5	1.33E-2
GO_REGULATION_OF_CELLULAR_RESPONSE_TO_STRESS	691	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of a cellular response to stress. Cellular response to stress is a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus indicating the organism is under stress. The stress is usually, but not necessarily, exogenous (e.g. temperature, humidity, ionizing radiation).	5	0.0072	3.14E-5	1.33E-2

GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_DEATH	1472	Any process that modulates the rate or frequency of cell death. Cell death is the specific activation or halting of processes within a cell so that its vital functions markedly cease, rather than simply deteriorating gradually over time, which culminates in cell death.	6	0.0041	1.12E-4	3.07E-2
