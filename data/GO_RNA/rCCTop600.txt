GO_CYTOSKELETON	1967	Any of the various filamentous elements that form the internal framework of cells, and typically remain after treatment of the cells with mild detergent to remove membrane constituents and soluble components of the cytoplasm. The term embraces intermediate filaments, microfilaments, microtubules, the microtrabecular lattice, and other structures characterized by a polymeric filamentous nature and long-range order within the cell. The various elements of the cytoskeleton not only serve in the maintenance of cellular shape but also have roles in other cellular functions, including cellular movement, cell division, endocytosis, and movement of organelles.	53	0.0269	3.61E-8	2.55E-6
GO_CENTRIOLE	102	A cellular organelle, found close to the nucleus in many eukaryotic cells, consisting of a small cylinder with microtubular walls, 300-500 nm long and 150-250 nm in diameter. It contains nine short, parallel, peripheral microtubular fibrils, each fibril consisting of one complete microtubule fused to two incomplete microtubules. Cells usually have two centrioles, lying at right angles to each other. At division, each pair of centrioles generates another pair and the twin pairs form the pole of the mitotic spindle.	11	0.1078	4.13E-8	2.55E-6
GO_INTRINSIC_COMPONENT_OF_PLASMA_MEMBRANE	1649	The component of the plasma membrane consisting of the gene products and protein complexes having either part of their peptide sequence embedded in the hydrophobic region of the membrane or some other covalently attached group such as a GPI anchor that is similarly embedded in the membrane.	47	0.0285	4.37E-8	2.55E-6
GO_CELL_PROJECTION_PART	946	Any constituent part of a cell projection, a prolongation or process extending from a cell, e.g. a flagellum or axon.	32	0.0338	1.76E-7	9.33E-6
GO_ENDOPLASMIC_RETICULUM	1631	The irregular network of unit membranes, visible only by electron microscopy, that occurs in the cytoplasm of many eukaryotic cells. The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae. The ER takes two forms, rough (or granular), with ribosomes adhering to the outer surface, and smooth (with no ribosomes attached).	45	0.0276	2.13E-7	1.04E-5
GO_SOMATODENDRITIC_COMPARTMENT	650	The region of a neuron that includes the cell body (cell soma) and the dendrite, but excludes the axon.	25	0.0385	3.96E-7	1.78E-5
GO_DENDRITE	451	A neuron projection that has a short, tapering, often branched, morphology, receives and integrates signals from other neurons or from sensory stimuli, and conducts a nerve impulse towards the axon or the cell body. In most neurons, the impulse is conveyed from dendrites to axon via the cell body, but in some types of unipolar neuron, the impulse does not travel via the cell body.	20	0.0443	6.62E-7	2.65E-5
GO_NEURON_PART	1265	Any constituent part of a neuron, the basic cellular unit of nervous tissue. A typical neuron consists of a cell body (often called the soma), an axon, and dendrites. Their purpose is to receive, conduct, and transmit impulses in the nervous system.	37	0.0292	6.8E-7	2.65E-5
GO_MICROTUBULE_ORGANIZING_CENTER_PART	145	Any constituent part of a microtubule organizing center, a region in a eukaryotic cell, such as a centrosome or basal body, from which microtubules grow.	11	0.0759	1.48E-6	5.41E-5
GO_APICAL_PART_OF_CELL	361	The region of a polarized cell that forms a tip or is distal to a base. For example, in a polarized epithelial cell, the apical region has an exposed surface and lies opposite to the basal lamina that separates the epithelium from other tissue.	17	0.0471	2.03E-6	6.97E-5
GO_CATALYTIC_COMPLEX	1038	A protein complex which is capable of catalytic activity.	31	0.0299	3.63E-6	1.18E-4
GO_GOLGI_APPARATUS	1445	A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions.	38	0.0263	5.8E-6	1.78E-4
GO_MICROTUBULE_CYTOSKELETON	1068	The part of the cytoskeleton (the internal framework of a cell) composed of microtubules and associated proteins.	31	0.0290	6.4E-6	1.87E-4
