GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_DEATH	1472	Any process that modulates the rate or frequency of cell death. Cell death is the specific activation or halting of processes within a cell so that its vital functions markedly cease, rather than simply deteriorating gradually over time, which culminates in cell death.	15	0.0102	2.68E-7	3.62E-4
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_NF_KAPPAB_TRANSCRIPTION_FACTOR_ACTIVITY	132	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB.	6	0.0455	3.11E-7	3.62E-4
GO_REGULATION_OF_CELLULAR_RESPONSE_TO_HEAT	76	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cellular response to heat.	5	0.0658	5.02E-7	4.67E-4
GO_REGULATION_OF_APOPTOTIC_SIGNALING_PATHWAY	363	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of apoptotic signaling pathway.	8	0.0220	7.97E-7	6.18E-4
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_RESPONSE_TO_STIMULUS	1929	Any process that activates, maintains or increases the rate of a response to a stimulus. Response to stimulus is a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus.	16	0.0083	1.56E-6	1.04E-3
GO_MOVEMENT_OF_CELL_OR_SUBCELLULAR_COMPONENT	1275	The directed, self-propelled movement of a cell or subcellular component without the involvement of an external agent such as a transporter or a pore.	13	0.0102	1.8E-6	1.05E-3
GO_APOPTOTIC_SIGNALING_PATHWAY	289	A series of molecular signals which triggers the apoptotic death of a cell. The pathway starts with reception of a signal, and ends when the execution phase of apoptosis is triggered.	7	0.0242	2.16E-6	1.12E-3
GO_LOCOMOTION	1114	Self-propelled movement of a cell or organism from one location to another.	12	0.0108	2.66E-6	1.24E-3
GO_NEGATIVE_REGULATION_OF_APOPTOTIC_SIGNALING_PATHWAY	200	Any process that stops, prevents or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of apoptotic signaling pathway.	6	0.0300	3.51E-6	1.48E-3
GO_REGULATION_OF_INCLUSION_BODY_ASSEMBLY	16	Any process that modulates the rate, frequency, or extent of inclusion body assembly. Inclusion body assembly is the aggregation, arrangement and bonding together of a set of components to form an inclusion body.	3	0.1875	4.41E-6	1.71E-3
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MULTICELLULAR_ORGANISMAL_PROCESS	1395	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of an organismal process, any of the processes pertinent to the function of an organism above the cellular level; includes the integrated processes of tissues and organs.	13	0.0093	4.8E-6	1.72E-3
GO_CELL_DEATH	1001	Any biological process that results in permanent cessation of all vital functions of a cell. A cell should be considered dead when any one of the following molecular or morphological criteria is met: (1) the cell has lost the integrity of its plasma membrane; (2) the cell, including its nucleus, has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies (frequently referred to as apoptotic bodies). The cell corpse (or its fragments) may be engulfed by an adjacent cell in vivo, but engulfment of whole cells should not be considered a strict criteria to define cell death as, under some circumstances, live engulfed cells can be released from phagosomes (see PMID:18045538).	11	0.0110	5.94E-6	1.86E-3
GO_REGULATION_OF_INTRACELLULAR_SIGNAL_TRANSDUCTION	1656	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of intracellular signal transduction.	14	0.0085	6.1E-6	1.86E-3
GO_PROTEIN_HYDROXYLATION	18	The addition of a hydroxy group to a protein amino acid.	3	0.1667	6.4E-6	1.86E-3
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_SEQUENCE_SPECIFIC_DNA_BINDING_TRANSCRIPTION_FACTOR_ACTIVITY	228	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of activity of a transcription factor, any factor involved in the initiation or regulation of transcription.	6	0.0263	7.42E-6	2.03E-3
GO_REGULATION_OF_RESPONSE_TO_STRESS	1468	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of a response to stress. Response to stress is a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a disturbance in organismal or cellular homeostasis, usually, but not necessarily, exogenous (e.g. temperature, humidity, ionizing radiation).	13	0.0089	8.28E-6	2.14E-3
GO_ANION_TRANSPORT	507	The directed movement of anions, atoms or small molecules with a net negative charge, into, out of or within a cell, or between cells, by means of some agent such as a transporter or pore.	8	0.0158	9.31E-6	2.28E-3
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_CYTOKINE_PRODUCTION	370	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of production of a cytokine.	7	0.0189	1.08E-5	2.39E-3
