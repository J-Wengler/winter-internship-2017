GO_DEFENSE_RESPONSE	1231	Reactions, triggered in response to the presence of a foreign body or the occurrence of an injury, which result in restriction of damage to the organism attacked or prevention/recovery from the infection caused by the attack.	154	0.1251	2.31E-55	1.79E-52
GO_REGULATION_OF_IMMUNE_SYSTEM_PROCESS	1403	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate, or extent of an immune system process.	159	0.1133	2.16E-51	1.44E-48
GO_REGULATION_OF_TRANSCRIPTION_FROM_RNA_POLYMERASE_II_PROMOTER	1784	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of transcription from an RNA polymerase II promoter.	178	0.0998	1.27E-49	7.4E-47

GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_BIOSYNTHETIC_PROCESS	1805	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of the chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of substances.	176	0.0975	1.19E-47	5.54E-45
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1733	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	171	0.0987	5.79E-47	2.45E-44
GO_TISSUE_DEVELOPMENT	1518	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of a tissue over time, from its formation to the mature structure.	157	0.1034	1.3E-45	4.67E-43
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MULTICELLULAR_ORGANISMAL_PROCESS	1395	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of an organismal process, any of the processes pertinent to the function of an organism above the cellular level; includes the integrated processes of tissues and organs.	150	0.1075	1.31E-45	4.67E-43
GO_REGULATION_OF_RESPONSE_TO_STRESS	1468	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of a response to stress. Response to stress is a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a disturbance in organismal or cellular homeostasis, usually, but not necessarily, exogenous (e.g. temperature, humidity, ionizing radiation).	154	0.1049	1.7E-45	5.63E-43
