GO_ACTIVE_TRANSMEMBRANE_TRANSPORTER_ACTIVITY	356	Catalysis of the transfer of a specific substance or related group of substances from one side of a membrane to the other, up the solute's concentration gradient.

The transporter binds the solute and undergoes a series of conformational changes. Transport works equally well in either direction and is driven by a chemiosmotic source of energy, not direct ATP coupling. Chemiosmotic sources of energy include uniport, symport or antiport.	9	0.0386	2.72E-7	2.11E-5
