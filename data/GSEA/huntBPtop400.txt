GO_IMMUNE_SYSTEM_PROCESS	1984	Any process involved in the development or functioning of the immune system, an organismal system for calibrated responses to potential internal or invasive threats.	74	0.0373	1.63E-31	7.6E-28
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1733	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	62	0.0358	2.42E-25	5.42E-22

GO_SKELETAL_SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT	455	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the skeleton over time, from its formation to the mature structure.

GO_PATTERN_SPECIFICATION_PROCESS	418	Any developmental process that results in the creation of defined areas or spaces within an organism to which cells respond and eventually are instructed to differentiate.	31	0.0742	7.73E-22	5.99E-19
GO_DEFENSE_RESPONSE	1231	Reactions, triggered in response to the presence of a foreign body or the occurrence of an injury, which result in restriction of damage to the organism attacked or prevention/recovery from the infection caused by the attack.	48	0.0390	3.37E-21	2.24E-18
GO_CELLULAR_RESPONSE_TO_ORGANIC_SUBSTANCE	1848	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an organic substance stimulus.	58	0.0314	5.91E-21	3.44E-18

GO_ORGAN_MORPHOGENESIS	841	Morphogenesis of an organ. An organ is defined as a tissue or set of tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions.	39	0.0464	6.46E-20	3.01E-17
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_TRANSCRIPTION_FROM_RNA_POLYMERASE_II_PROMOTER	1004	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of transcription from an RNA polymerase II promoter.	41	0.0408	6.49E-19	2.75E-16
GO_IMMUNE_RESPONSE	1100	Any immune system process that functions in the calibrated response of an organism to a potential internal or invasive threat.	42	0.0382	2.65E-18	1.03E-15
GO_REGULATION_OF_MULTICELLULAR_ORGANISMAL_DEVELOPMENT	1672	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of multicellular organismal development.	51	0.0305	5.97E-18	2.14E-15
GO_RESPONSE_TO_EXTERNAL_STIMULUS	1821	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an external stimulus.	53	0.0291	9.09E-18	3.02E-15
GO_REGIONALIZATION	311	The pattern specification process that results in the subdivision of an axis or axes in space to define an area or volume in which specific patterns of cell differentiation will take place or in which cells interpret a specific environment.	24	0.0772	1.46E-17	4.54E-15
GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_DIFFERENTIATION	1492	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell differentiation, the process in which relatively unspecialized cells acquire specialized structural and functional features.	47	0.0315	4.02E-17	1.17E-14
GO_EMBRYO_DEVELOPMENT	894	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of an embryo from its formation until the end of its embryonic life stage. The end of the embryonic stage is organism-specific. For example, for mammals, the process would begin with zygote formation and end with birth. For insects, the process would begin at zygote formation and end with larval hatching. For plant zygotic embryos, this would be from zygote formation to the end of seed dormancy. For plant vegetative embryos, this would be from the initial determination of the cell or group of cells to form an embryo until the point when the embryo becomes independent of the parent plant.	36	0.0403	1.58E-16	4.33E-14
GO_ANTERIOR_POSTERIOR_PATTERN_SPECIFICATION	194	The regionalization process in which specific areas of cell differentiation are determined along the anterior-posterior axis. The anterior-posterior axis is defined by a line that runs from the head or mouth of an organism to the tail or opposite end of the organism.	19	0.0979	4.53E-16	1.17E-13
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_RESPONSE_TO_STIMULUS	1929	Any process that activates, maintains or increases the rate of a response to a stimulus. Response to stimulus is a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus.	51	0.0264	1.93E-15	4.73E-13
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MULTICELLULAR_ORGANISMAL_PROCESS	1395	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of an organismal process, any of the processes pertinent to the function of an organism above the cellular level; includes the integrated processes of tissues and organs.	43	0.0308	2.13E-15	4.95E-13
