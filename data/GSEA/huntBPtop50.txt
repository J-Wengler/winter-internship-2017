GO_SKELETAL_SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT	455	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the skeleton over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The skeleton is the bony framework of the body in vertebrates (endoskeleton) or the hard outer envelope of insects (exoskeleton or dermoskeleton).	17	0.0374	3.04E-22	1.42E-18
GO_PATTERN_SPECIFICATION_PROCESS	418	Any developmental process that results in the creation of defined areas or spaces within an organism to which cells respond and eventually are instructed to differentiate.	13	0.0311	4.73E-16	1.05E-12
GO_EMBRYO_DEVELOPMENT	894	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of an embryo from its formation until the end of its embryonic life stage. The end of the embryonic stage is organism-specific. For example, for mammals, the process would begin with zygote formation and end with birth. For insects, the process would begin at zygote formation and end with larval hatching. For plant zygotic embryos, this would be from zygote formation to the end of seed dormancy. For plant vegetative embryos, this would be from the initial determination of the cell or group of cells to form an embryo until the point when the embryo becomes independent of the parent plant.	16	0.0179	6.78E-16	1.05E-12
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_TRANSCRIPTION_FROM_RNA_POLYMERASE_II_PROMOTER	1004	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of transcription from an RNA polymerase II promoter.	16	0.0159	4.09E-15	4.75E-12
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1733	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	19	0.0110	5.21E-15	4.85E-12
GO_REGULATION_OF_TRANSCRIPTION_FROM_RNA_POLYMERASE_II_PROMOTER	1784	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of transcription from an RNA polymerase II promoter.	18	0.0101	1.35E-13	1.05E-10
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_BIOSYNTHETIC_PROCESS	1805	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of the chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of substances.	18	0.0100	1.65E-13	1.1E-10
GO_EMBRYONIC_MORPHOGENESIS	539	The process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized during the embryonic phase. The embryonic phase begins with zygote formation. The end of the embryonic phase is organism-specific. For example, it would be at birth for mammals, larval hatching for insects and seed dormancy in plants.	12	0.0223	3.73E-13	2.17E-10
GO_ANTERIOR_POSTERIOR_PATTERN_SPECIFICATION	194	The regionalization process in which specific areas of cell differentiation are determined along the anterior-posterior axis. The anterior-posterior axis is defined by a line that runs from the head or mouth of an organism to the tail or opposite end of the organism.	9	0.0464	6.27E-13	3.24E-10
GO_EMBRYONIC_SKELETAL_SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT	122	The process, occurring during the embryonic phase, whose specific outcome is the progression of the skeleton over time, from its formation to the mature structure.	8	0.0656	8.04E-13	3.74E-10
GO_REGIONALIZATION	311	The pattern specification process that results in the subdivision of an axis or axes in space to define an area or volume in which specific patterns of cell differentiation will take place or in which cells interpret a specific environment.	10	0.0322	1.13E-12	4.8E-10
GO_APPENDAGE_DEVELOPMENT	169	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of an appendage over time, from its formation to the mature structure. An appendage is an organ or part that is attached to the trunk of an organism, such as a limb or a branch.	8	0.0473	1.12E-11	4.02E-9
GO_LIMB_DEVELOPMENT	169	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of a limb over time, from its formation to the mature structure. A limb is an appendage of an animal used for locomotion or grasping. Examples include legs, arms or some types of fin.	8	0.0473	1.12E-11	4.02E-9
GO_EMBRYO_DEVELOPMENT_ENDING_IN_BIRTH_OR_EGG_HATCHING	554	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of an embryo over time, from zygote formation until the end of the embryonic life stage. The end of the embryonic life stage is organism-specific and may be somewhat arbitrary; for mammals it is usually considered to be birth, for insects the hatching of the first instar larva from the eggshell.	11	0.0199	1.36E-11	4.53E-9
GO_MUSCLE_ORGAN_DEVELOPMENT	277	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the muscle over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The muscle is an organ consisting of a tissue made up of various elongated cells that are specialized to contract and thus to produce movement and mechanical work.	9	0.0325	1.53E-11	4.76E-9
GO_MUSCLE_STRUCTURE_DEVELOPMENT	432	The progression of a muscle structure over time, from its formation to its mature state. Muscle structures are contractile cells, tissues or organs that are found in multicellular organisms.	10	0.0231	2.88E-11	8.37E-9

GO_PROXIMAL_DISTAL_PATTERN_FORMATION	32	The regionalization process in which specific areas of cell differentiation are determined along a proximal/distal axis. The proximal/distal axis is defined by a line that runs from main body (proximal end) of an organism outward (distal end).	5	0.1562	2.2E-10	5.69E-8
GO_MUSCLE_TISSUE_DEVELOPMENT	275	The progression of muscle tissue over time, from its initial formation to its mature state. Muscle tissue is a contractile tissue made up of actin and myosin fibers.	8	0.0291	5.41E-10	1.33E-7
GO_EMBRYONIC_ORGAN_MORPHOGENESIS	279	Morphogenesis, during the embryonic phase, of a tissue or tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions.	8	0.0287	6.07E-10	1.41E-7
