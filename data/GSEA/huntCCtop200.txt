GO_PERINUCLEAR_REGION_OF_CYTOPLASM	642	Cytoplasm situated near, or occurring around, the nucleus.	17	0.0265	4.03E-10	2.36E-7
GO_VACUOLE	1180	A closed structure, found only in eukaryotic cells, that is completely surrounded by unit membrane and contains liquid material. Cells contain one or several vacuoles, that may have different functions from each other. Vacuoles have a diverse array of functions. They can act as a storage organelle for nutrients or waste products, as a degradative compartment, as a cost-effective way of increasing cell size, and as a homeostatic regulator controlling both turgor pressure and pH of the cytosol.	20	0.0169	2.22E-8	6.48E-6
GO_INTRINSIC_COMPONENT_OF_PLASMA_MEMBRANE	1649	The component of the plasma membrane consisting of the gene products and protein complexes having either part of their peptide sequence embedded in the hydrophobic region of the membrane or some other covalently attached group such as a GPI anchor that is similarly embedded in the membrane.	21	0.0127	1.09E-6	2.12E-4

GO_VACUOLAR_MEMBRANE	587	The lipid bilayer surrounding the vacuole and separating its contents from the cytoplasm of the cell.	11	0.0187	1.49E-5	1.33E-3
GO_CYTOSKELETON	1967	Any of the various filamentous elements that form the internal framework of cells, and typically remain after treatment of the cells with mild detergent to remove membrane constituents and soluble components of the cytoplasm. The term embraces intermediate filaments, microfilaments, microtubules, the microtrabecular lattice, and other structures characterized by a polymeric filamentous nature and long-range order within the cell. The various elements of the cytoskeleton not only serve in the maintenance of cellular shape but also have roles in other cellular functions, including cellular movement, cell division, endocytosis, and movement of organelles.	21	0.0107	1.63E-5	1.33E-3
GO_TRANSCRIPTION_FACTOR_COMPLEX	298	A protein complex that is capable of associating with DNA by direct binding, or via other DNA-binding proteins or complexes, and regulating transcription.	8	0.0268	1.83E-5	1.33E-3
GO_INTRACELLULAR_VESICLE	1259	Any vesicle that is part of the intracellular region.	16	0.0127	2.3E-5	1.49E-3
GO_MEMBRANE_REGION	1134	A membrane that is a part of a larger membrane.  Examples include the apical region of the plasma membrane of an epithelial cell and the various regions of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.	15	0.0132	2.65E-5	1.55E-3
GO_ENDOSOMAL_PART	430	Any constituent part of an endosome, a membrane-bounded organelle to which materials ingested by endocytosis are delivered.	9	0.0209	3.88E-5	2.06E-3
GO_EXTRACELLULAR_MATRIX	426	A structure lying external to one or more cells, which provides structural support for cells or tissues; may be completely external to the cell (as in animals and bacteria) or be part of the cell (as in plants).	8	0.0188	2.19E-4	1.07E-2
GO_PHAGOCYTIC_VESICLE	86	A membrane-bounded intracellular vesicle that arises from the ingestion of particulate material by phagocytosis.	4	0.0465	3.17E-4	1.42E-2
GO_PROTEINACEOUS_EXTRACELLULAR_MATRIX	356	A layer consisting mainly of proteins (especially collagen) and glycosaminoglycans (mostly as proteoglycans) that forms a sheet underlying or overlying cells such as endothelial and epithelial cells. The proteins are secreted by cells in the vicinity. An example of this component is found in Mus musculus.	7	0.0197	4.14E-4	1.73E-2
GO_CYTOPLASMIC_VESICLE_PART	601	Any constituent part of cytoplasmic vesicle, a vesicle formed of membrane or protein, found in the cytoplasm of a cell.	9	0.0150	4.7E-4	1.83E-2

GO_BASOLATERAL_PLASMA_MEMBRANE	211	The region of the plasma membrane that includes the basal end and sides of the cell. Often used in reference to animal polarized epithelial membranes, where the basal membrane is the part attached to the extracellular matrix, or in plant cells, where the basal membrane is defined with respect to the zygotic axis.	5	0.0237	1.24E-3	3.81E-2
