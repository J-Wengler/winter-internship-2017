GO_RESPONSE_TO_EXTERNAL_STIMULUS	1821	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an external stimulus.	108	0.0593	5.56E-36	5.17E-33
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1733	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	105	0.0606	9.23E-36	7.16E-33
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_BIOSYNTHETIC_PROCESS	1805	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of the chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of substances.	106	0.0587	6.26E-35	4.16E-32
GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_PROLIFERATION	1496	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell proliferation.	96	0.0642	1.22E-34	7.11E-32
GO_DEFENSE_RESPONSE	1231	Reactions, triggered in response to the presence of a foreign body or the occurrence of an injury, which result in restriction of damage to the organism attacked or prevention/recovery from the infection caused by the attack.	87	0.0707	1.85E-34	9.57E-32
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MULTICELLULAR_ORGANISMAL_PROCESS	1395	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of an organismal process, any of the processes pertinent to the function of an organism above the cellular level; includes the integrated processes of tissues and organs.	92	0.0659	4.22E-34	1.96E-31
GO_TISSUE_DEVELOPMENT	1518	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of a tissue over time, from its formation to the mature structure.	94	0.0619	1.06E-32	4.47E-30
GO_REGULATION_OF_IMMUNE_SYSTEM_PROCESS	1403	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate, or extent of an immune system process.	90	0.0641	1.89E-32	7.33E-30
GO_ORGAN_MORPHOGENESIS	841	Morphogenesis of an organ. An organ is defined as a tissue or set of tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions.	70	0.0832	4.12E-32	1.47E-29
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_RESPONSE_TO_STIMULUS	1929	Any process that activates, maintains or increases the rate of a response to a stimulus. Response to stimulus is a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus.	104	0.0539	3.76E-31	1.25E-28
GO_REGULATION_OF_MULTICELLULAR_ORGANISMAL_DEVELOPMENT	1672	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of multicellular organismal development.	96	0.0574	7.9E-31	2.45E-28
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_TRANSCRIPTION_FROM_RNA_POLYMERASE_II_PROMOTER	1004	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of transcription from an RNA polymerase II promoter.	74	0.0737	1.68E-30	4.88E-28
GO_SKELETAL_SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT	455	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the skeleton over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The skeleton is the bony framework of the body in vertebrates (endoskeleton) or the hard outer envelope of insects (exoskeleton or dermoskeleton).	51	0.1121	1.23E-29	3.37E-27
GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_DIFFERENTIATION	1492	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell differentiation, the process in which relatively unspecialized cells acquire specialized structural and functional features.	87	0.0583	2.09E-28	5.39E-26
GO_REGULATION_OF_RESPONSE_TO_STRESS	1468	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of a response to stress. Response to stress is a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a disturbance in organismal or cellular homeostasis, usually, but not necessarily, exogenous (e.g. temperature, humidity, ionizing radiation).	84	0.0572	7.04E-27	1.72E-24
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_IMMUNE_SYSTEM_PROCESS	867	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate, or extent of an immune system process.	64	0.0738	1.69E-26	3.93E-24
