GO_SKELETAL_SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT	455	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the skeleton over time, from its formation to the mature structure.

GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_TRANSCRIPTION_FROM_RNA_POLYMERASE_II_PROMOTER	1004	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of transcription from an RNA polymerase II promoter.	27	0.0269	1.25E-15	8.29E-13
GO_CELLULAR_RESPONSE_TO_ORGANIC_SUBSTANCE	1848	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an organic substance stimulus.	35	0.0189	2.02E-15	1.18E-12
GO_REGIONALIZATION	311	The pattern specification process that results in the subdivision of an axis or axes in space to define an area or volume in which specific patterns of cell differentiation will take place or in which cells interpret a specific environment.	17	0.0547	4.12E-15	2.13E-12
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_GENE_EXPRESSION	1733	Any process that increases the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.	33	0.0190	1.25E-14	5.8E-12
GO_ORGAN_MORPHOGENESIS	841	Morphogenesis of an organ. An organ is defined as a tissue or set of tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions.	24	0.0285	1.51E-14	6.41E-12
GO_CELLULAR_RESPONSE_TO_ZINC_ION	16	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a zinc ion stimulus.	7	0.4375	1.01E-13	3.92E-11
GO_EMBRYO_DEVELOPMENT	894	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of an embryo from its formation until the end of its embryonic life stage. The end of the embryonic stage is organism-specific. For example, for mammals, the process would begin with zygote formation and end with birth. For insects, the process would begin at zygote formation and end with larval hatching. For plant zygotic embryos, this would be from zygote formation to the end of seed dormancy. For plant vegetative embryos, this would be from the initial determination of the cell or group of cells to form an embryo until the point when the embryo becomes independent of the parent plant.	23	0.0257	4.74E-13	1.7E-10
GO_ANTERIOR_POSTERIOR_PATTERN_SPECIFICATION	194	The regionalization process in which specific areas of cell differentiation are determined along the anterior-posterior axis. The anterior-posterior axis is defined by a line that runs from the head or mouth of an organism to the tail or opposite end of the organism.	13	0.0670	5.83E-13	1.94E-10
GO_TRANSCRIPTION_FROM_RNA_POLYMERASE_II_PROMOTER	724	The synthesis of RNA from a DNA template by RNA polymerase II, originating at an RNA polymerase II promoter. Includes transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) and certain small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs).	20	0.0276	4.91E-12	1.52E-9
GO_EMBRYONIC_MORPHOGENESIS	539	The process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized during the embryonic phase. The embryonic phase begins with zygote formation. The end of the embryonic phase is organism-specific. For example, it would be at birth for mammals, larval hatching for insects and seed dormancy in plants.	17	0.0315	2.76E-11	8.01E-9
GO_GLAND_DEVELOPMENT	395	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of a gland over time, from its formation to the mature structure. A gland is an organ specialised for secretion.	15	0.0380	3.24E-11	8.85E-9
GO_RESPONSE_TO_ZINC_ION	55	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a zinc ion stimulus.	8	0.1455	3.43E-11	8.85E-9
GO_DEFENSE_RESPONSE	1231	Reactions, triggered in response to the presence of a foreign body or the occurrence of an injury, which result in restriction of damage to the organism attacked or prevention/recovery from the infection caused by the attack.	24	0.0195	4.62E-11	1.1E-8
GO_APPENDAGE_DEVELOPMENT	169	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of an appendage over time, from its formation to the mature structure. An appendage is an organ or part that is attached to the trunk of an organism, such as a limb or a branch.	11	0.0651	5.06E-11	1.1E-8
