GO_INTRINSIC_COMPONENT_OF_PLASMA_MEMBRANE	1649	The component of the plasma membrane consisting of the gene products and protein complexes having either part of their peptide sequence embedded in the hydrophobic region of the membrane or some other covalently attached group such as a GPI anchor that is similarly embedded in the membrane.	289	0.1753	4.87E-72	2.84E-69
GO_VACUOLE	1180	A closed structure, found only in eukaryotic cells, that is completely surrounded by unit membrane and contains liquid material. Cells contain one or several vacuoles, that may have different functions from each other. Vacuoles have a diverse array of functions. They can act as a storage organelle for nutrients or waste products, as a degradative compartment, as a cost-effective way of increasing cell size, and as a homeostatic regulator controlling both turgor pressure and pH of the cytosol.	210	0.1780	3.43E-53	1E-50
GO_EXTRACELLULAR_SPACE	1376	That part of a multicellular organism outside the cells proper, usually taken to be outside the plasma membranes, and occupied by fluid.	226	0.1642	4.89E-51	9.51E-49
GO_CYTOSKELETON	1967	Any of the various filamentous elements that form the internal framework of cells, and typically remain after treatment of the cells with mild detergent to remove membrane constituents and soluble components of the cytoplasm. The term embraces intermediate filaments, microfilaments, microtubules, the microtrabecular lattice, and other structures characterized by a polymeric filamentous nature and long-range order within the cell. The various elements of the cytoskeleton not only serve in the maintenance of cellular shape but also have roles in other cellular functions, including cellular movement, cell division, endocytosis, and movement of organelles.	278	0.1413	1.86E-49	2.72E-47
GO_CELL_PROJECTION	1786	A prolongation or process extending from a cell, e.g. a flagellum or axon.	259	0.1450	4.35E-48	5.08E-46
GO_GOLGI_APPARATUS	1445	A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions.	225	0.1557	7.88E-47	7.67E-45
GO_ENDOPLASMIC_RETICULUM	1631	The irregular network of unit membranes, visible only by electron microscopy, that occurs in the cytoplasm of many eukaryotic cells. The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae. The ER takes two forms, rough (or granular), with ribosomes adhering to the outer surface, and smooth (with no ribosomes attached).	239	0.1465	4.13E-45	3.45E-43
GO_INTRACELLULAR_VESICLE	1259	Any vesicle that is part of the intracellular region.	200	0.1589	6.25E-43	4.56E-41
GO_MEMBRANE_REGION	1134	A membrane that is a part of a larger membrane.  Examples include the apical region of the plasma membrane of an epithelial cell and the various regions of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.	183	0.1614	2.96E-40	1.92E-38
GO_CELL_SURFACE	757	The external part of the cell wall and/or plasma membrane.	137	0.1810	1.14E-35	6.65E-34

GO_CELL_JUNCTION	1151	A cellular component that forms a specialized region of connection between two or more cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. At a cell junction, anchoring proteins extend through the plasma membrane to link cytoskeletal proteins in one cell to cytoskeletal proteins in neighboring cells or to proteins in the extracellular matrix.	172	0.1494	1.39E-33	6.77E-32
GO_ENDOSOME	793	A vacuole to which materials ingested by endocytosis are delivered.	136	0.1715	6.95E-33	3.12E-31
GO_ENDOPLASMIC_RETICULUM_PART	1163	Any constituent part of the endoplasmic reticulum, the irregular network of unit membranes, visible only by electron microscopy, that occurs in the cytoplasm of many eukaryotic cells. The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae.	171	0.1470	1.61E-32	6.71E-31

GO_NEURON_PART	1265	Any constituent part of a neuron, the basic cellular unit of nervous tissue. A typical neuron consists of a cell body (often called the soma), an axon, and dendrites. Their purpose is to receive, conduct, and transmit impulses in the nervous system.	180	0.1423	2.27E-32	8.3E-31
