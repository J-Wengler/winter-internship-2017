GO_SEQUENCE_SPECIFIC_DNA_BINDING	1037	Interacting selectively and non-covalently with DNA of a specific nucleotide composition, e.g. GC-rich DNA binding, or with a specific sequence motif or type of DNA e.g. promotor binding or rDNA binding.	15	0.0145	4.8E-19	4.46E-16
GO_NUCLEIC_ACID_BINDING_TRANSCRIPTION_FACTOR_ACTIVITY	1199	Interacting selectively and non-covalently with a DNA or RNA sequence in order to modulate transcription. The transcription factor may or may not also interact selectively with a protein or macromolecular complex.	9	0.0075	7.62E-9	3.54E-6
GO_RNA_POLYMERASE_II_TRANSCRIPTION_FACTOR_ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE_SPECIFIC_DNA_BINDING	629	Interacting selectively and non-covalently with a specific DNA sequence in order to modulate transcription by RNA polymerase II.
