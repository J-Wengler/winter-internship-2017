GO_CALCIUM_DEPENDENT_PHOSPHOLIPID_BINDING	56	Interacting selectively and non-covalently with phospholipids, a class of lipids containing phosphoric acid as a mono- or diester, in the presence of calcium.	3	0.0536	3.87E-6	2.82E-3
GO_CLATHRIN_BINDING	65	Interacting selectively and non-covalently with a clathrin heavy or light chain, the main components of the coat of coated vesicles and coated pits, and which also occurs in synaptic vesicles.	3	0.0462	6.07E-6	2.82E-3
GO_SYNTAXIN_BINDING	93	Interacting selectively and non-covalently with a syntaxin, a SNAP receptor involved in the docking of synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic zone of a synapse.	3	0.0323	1.79E-5	5.52E-3
GO_MAP_KINASE_ACTIVITY	14	Catalysis of the reaction: protein + ATP = protein phosphate + ADP. This reaction is the phosphorylation of proteins. Mitogen-activated protein kinase; a family of protein kinases that perform a crucial step in relaying signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. They are activated by a wide range of proliferation- or differentiation-inducing signals; activation is strong with agonists such as polypeptide growth factors and tumor-promoting phorbol esters, but weak (in most cell backgrounds) by stress stimuli.	2	0.1429	2.58E-5	5.52E-3
