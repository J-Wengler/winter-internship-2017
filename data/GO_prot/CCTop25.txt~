GO_MITOCHONDRION	1633	A semiautonomous, self replicating organelle that occurs in varying numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of virtually all eukaryotic cells. It is notably the site of tissue respiration.	11	0.0067	3.11E-10	1.81E-7
GO_NEURON_PART	1265	Any constituent part of a neuron, the basic cellular unit of nervous tissue. A typical neuron consists of a cell body (often called the soma), an axon, and dendrites. Their purpose is to receive, conduct, and transmit impulses in the nervous system.	9	0.0071	1.21E-8	3.54E-6
GO_MITOCHONDRIAL_PART	953	Any constituent part of a mitochondrion, a semiautonomous, self replicating organelle that occurs in varying numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of virtually all eukaryotic cells. It is notably the site of tissue respiration.	8	0.0084	2.63E-8	5.11E-6
GO_MITOCHONDRIAL_MATRIX	412	The gel-like material, with considerable fine structure, that lies in the matrix space, or lumen, of a mitochondrion. It contains the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and, in some organisms, the enzymes concerned with fatty acid oxidation.	6	0.0146	7.68E-8	1.12E-5
GO_CELL_JUNCTION	1151	A cellular component that forms a specialized region of connection between two or more cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. At a cell junction, anchoring proteins extend through the plasma membrane to link cytoskeletal proteins in one cell to cytoskeletal proteins in neighboring cells or to proteins in the extracellular matrix.	8	0.0070	1.12E-7	1.31E-5
GO_CELL_PROJECTION	1786	A prolongation or process extending from a cell, e.g. a flagellum or axon.	9	0.0050	2.3E-7	2.24E-5

GO_EXOCYTIC_VESICLE	142	A transport vesicle that mediates transport from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane, and fuses with the plasma membrane to release various cargo molecules, such as proteins or hormones, by exocytosis.	4	0.0282	1.05E-6	7.67E-5

GO_SYNAPSE_PART	610	Any constituent part of a synapse, the junction between a nerve fiber of one neuron and another neuron or muscle fiber or glial cell.	5	0.0082	1.73E-5	7.21E-4

GO_TRANSPORT_VESICLE	338	Any of the vesicles of the constitutive secretory pathway, which carry cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, between Golgi cisternae, from the Golgi to the ER (retrograde transport) or to destinations within or outside the cell.	4	0.0118	3.22E-5	1.17E-3
GO_PSEUDOPODIUM	17	A temporary protrusion or retractile process of a cell, associated with flowing movements of the protoplasm, and serving for locomotion and feeding.	2	0.1176	3.84E-5	1.32E-3
GO_INTRACELLULAR_VESICLE	1259	Any vesicle that is part of the intracellular region.	6	0.0048	4.73E-5	1.46E-3
GO_SYNAPSE	754	The junction between a nerve fiber of one neuron and another neuron or muscle fiber or glial cell; the site of interneuronal communication. As the nerve fiber approaches the synapse it enlarges into a specialized structure, the presynaptic nerve ending, which contains mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. At the tip of the nerve ending is the presynaptic membrane; facing it, and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft) is a specialized area of membrane on the receiving cell, known as the postsynaptic membrane. In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic nerve ending secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane.	5	0.0066	4.75E-5	1.46E-3
GO_AXON	418	The long process of a neuron that conducts nerve impulses, usually away from the cell body to the terminals and varicosities, which are sites of storage and release of neurotransmitter.	4	0.0096	7.34E-5	2.11E-3
