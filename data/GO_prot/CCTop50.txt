GO_CELL_BODY	494	The portion of a cell bearing surface projections such as axons, dendrites, cilia, or flagella that includes the nucleus, but excludes all cell projections.	8	0.0162	6.09E-8	5.93E-6
GO_NADH_DEHYDROGENASE_COMPLEX	42	An integral membrane complex that possesses NADH oxidoreductase activity. The complex is one of the components of the electron transport chain. It catalyzes the transfer of a pair of electrons from NADH to a quinone.	4	0.0952	1.35E-7	1.12E-5
GO_MITOCHONDRIAL_MATRIX	412	The gel-like material, with considerable fine structure, that lies in the matrix space, or lumen, of a mitochondrion. It contains the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and, in some organisms, the enzymes concerned with fatty acid oxidation.	7	0.0170	3.17E-7	2.31E-5
GO_CELL_JUNCTION	1151	A cellular component that forms a specialized region of connection between two or more cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. At a cell junction, anchoring proteins extend through the plasma membrane to link cytoskeletal proteins in one cell to cytoskeletal proteins in neighboring cells or to proteins in the extracellular matrix.	10	0.0087	3.86E-7	2.34E-5
GO_MITOCHONDRIAL_PROTEIN_COMPLEX	136	A protein complex that is part of a mitochondrion.	5	0.0368	4.01E-7	2.34E-5

GO_MITOCHONDRIAL_MEMBRANE_PART	173	Any constituent part of a mitochondrial membrane, either of the lipid bilayers that surround the mitochondrion and form the mitochondrial envelope.	5	0.0289	1.32E-6	6.28E-5

GO_RESPIRATORY_CHAIN	80	The protein complexes that form the electron transport system (the respiratory chain), associated with a cell membrane, usually the plasma membrane (in prokaryotes) or the inner mitochondrial membrane (on eukaryotes). The respiratory chain complexes transfer electrons from an electron donor to an electron acceptor and are associated with a proton pump to create a transmembrane electrochemical gradient.	4	0.0500	1.84E-6	7.69E-5
GO_MICROTUBULE_CYTOSKELETON	1068	The part of the cytoskeleton (the internal framework of a cell) composed of microtubules and associated proteins.	9	0.0084	2.04E-6	7.93E-5
GO_INNER_MITOCHONDRIAL_MEMBRANE_PROTEIN_COMPLEX	106	Any protein complex that is part of the inner mitochondrial membrane.	4	0.0377	5.67E-6	2.07E-4
GO_AXON	418	The long process of a neuron that conducts nerve impulses, usually away from the cell body to the terminals and varicosities, which are sites of storage and release of neurotransmitter.	6	0.0144	6.19E-6	2.1E-4
GO_SOMATODENDRITIC_COMPARTMENT	650	The region of a neuron that includes the cell body (cell soma) and the dendrite, but excludes the axon.	7	0.0108	6.46E-6	2.1E-4
GO_CYTOSKELETON	1967	Any of the various filamentous elements that form the internal framework of cells, and typically remain after treatment of the cells with mild detergent to remove membrane constituents and soluble components of the cytoplasm. The term embraces intermediate filaments, microfilaments, microtubules, the microtrabecular lattice, and other structures characterized by a polymeric filamentous nature and long-range order within the cell. The various elements of the cytoskeleton not only serve in the maintenance of cellular shape but also have roles in other cellular functions, including cellular movement, cell division, endocytosis, and movement of organelles.	11	0.0056	6.86E-6	2.11E-4
GO_DENDRITE	451	A neuron projection that has a short, tapering, often branched, morphology, receives and integrates signals from other neurons or from sensory stimuli, and conducts a nerve impulse towards the axon or the cell body. In most neurons, the impulse is conveyed from dendrites to axon via the cell body, but in some types of unipolar neuron, the impulse does not travel via the cell body.	6	0.0133	9.53E-6	2.78E-4
