GO_MITOCHONDRION	1633	A semiautonomous, self replicating organelle that occurs in varying numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of virtually all eukaryotic cells. It is notably the site of tissue respiration.	11	0.0067	3.11E-10	1.81E-7
GO_NEURON_PART	1265	Any constituent part of a neuron, the basic cellular unit of nervous tissue. A typical neuron consists of a cell body (often called the soma), an axon, and dendrites. Their purpose is to receive, conduct, and transmit impulses in the nervous system.	9	0.0071	1.21E-8	3.54E-6
GO_MITOCHONDRIAL_PART	953	Any constituent part of a mitochondrion, a semiautonomous, self replicating organelle that occurs in varying numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of virtually all eukaryotic cells. It is notably the site of tissue respiration.	8	0.0084	2.63E-8	5.11E-6
GO_MITOCHONDRIAL_MATRIX	412	The gel-like material, with considerable fine structure, that lies in the matrix space, or lumen, of a mitochondrion. It contains the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and, in some organisms, the enzymes concerned with fatty acid oxidation.	6	0.0146	7.68E-8	1.12E-5
GO_CELL_JUNCTION	1151	A cellular component that forms a specialized region of connection between two or more cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. At a cell junction, anchoring proteins extend through the plasma membrane to link cytoskeletal proteins in one cell to cytoskeletal proteins in neighboring cells or to proteins in the extracellular matrix.	8	0.0070	1.12E-7	1.31E-5
GO_CELL_PROJECTION	1786	A prolongation or process extending from a cell, e.g. a flagellum or axon.	9	0.0050	2.3E-7	2.24E-5
GO_NEURON_PROJECTION	942	A prolongation or process extending from a nerve cell, e.g. an axon or dendrite.	7	0.0074	5.18E-7	4.32E-5
GO_EXOCYTIC_VESICLE	142	A transport vesicle that mediates transport from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane, and fuses with the plasma membrane to release various cargo molecules, such as proteins or hormones, by exocytosis.	4	0.0282	1.05E-6	7.67E-5
GO_EXOCYTIC_VESICLE_MEMBRANE	56	The lipid bilayer surrounding an exocytic vesicle	3	0.0536	3.87E-6	2.51E-4
GO_CELL_BODY	494	The portion of a cell bearing surface projections such as axons, dendrites, cilia, or flagella that includes the nucleus, but excludes all cell projections.	5	0.0101	6.26E-6	3.65E-4
GO_VESICLE_MEMBRANE	512	The lipid bilayer surrounding any membrane-bounded vesicle in the cell.	5	0.0098	7.44E-6	3.95E-4
GO_PRESYNAPSE	283	The part of a synapse that is part of the presynaptic cell.	4	0.0141	1.61E-5	7.21E-4
GO_CYTOPLASMIC_VESICLE_PART	601	Any constituent part of cytoplasmic vesicle, a vesicle formed of membrane or protein, found in the cytoplasm of a cell.	5	0.0083	1.61E-5	7.21E-4
GO_SYNAPSE_PART	610	Any constituent part of a synapse, the junction between a nerve fiber of one neuron and another neuron or muscle fiber or glial cell.	5	0.0082	1.73E-5	7.21E-4
GO_CLATHRIN_SCULPTED_VESICLE	12	A clathrin-sculpted lipid bilayer membrane-enclosed vesicle after clathrin release.	2	0.1667	1.87E-5	7.28E-4
GO_TRANSPORT_VESICLE	338	Any of the vesicles of the constitutive secretory pathway, which carry cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, between Golgi cisternae, from the Golgi to the ER (retrograde transport) or to destinations within or outside the cell.	4	0.0118	3.22E-5	1.17E-3
GO_PSEUDOPODIUM	17	A temporary protrusion or retractile process of a cell, associated with flowing movements of the protoplasm, and serving for locomotion and feeding.	2	0.1176	3.84E-5	1.32E-3
GO_INTRACELLULAR_VESICLE	1259	Any vesicle that is part of the intracellular region.	6	0.0048	4.73E-5	1.46E-3
GO_SYNAPSE	754	The junction between a nerve fiber of one neuron and another neuron or muscle fiber or glial cell; the site of interneuronal communication. As the nerve fiber approaches the synapse it enlarges into a specialized structure, the presynaptic nerve ending, which contains mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. At the tip of the nerve ending is the presynaptic membrane; facing it, and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft) is a specialized area of membrane on the receiving cell, known as the postsynaptic membrane. In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic nerve ending secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane.	5	0.0066	4.75E-5	1.46E-3
GO_AXON	418	The long process of a neuron that conducts nerve impulses, usually away from the cell body to the terminals and varicosities, which are sites of storage and release of neurotransmitter.	4	0.0096	7.34E-5	2.11E-3
