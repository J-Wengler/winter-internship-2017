GO_NEURON_PART	1265	Any constituent part of a neuron, the basic cellular unit of nervous tissue. A typical neuron consists of a cell body (often called the soma), an axon, and dendrites. Their purpose is to receive, conduct, and transmit impulses in the nervous system.	54	0.0427	1.02E-29	4.95E-28
GO_NADH_DEHYDROGENASE_COMPLEX	42	An integral membrane complex that possesses NADH oxidoreductase activity. The complex is one of the components of the electron transport chain. It catalyzes the transfer of a pair of electrons from NADH to a quinone.	18	0.4286	2.23E-29	1E-27
GO_MYELIN_SHEATH	168	An electrically insulating fatty layer that surrounds the axons of many neurons. It is an outgrowth of glial cells: Schwann cells supply the myelin for peripheral neurons while oligodendrocytes supply it to those of the central nervous system.	26	0.1548	7.65E-29	3.19E-27
GO_CELL_PROJECTION	1786	A prolongation or process extending from a cell, e.g. a flagellum or axon.	59	0.0330	1.12E-26	4.36E-25

GO_CELL_JUNCTION	1151	A cellular component that forms a specialized region of connection between two or more cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. At a cell junction, anchoring proteins extend through the plasma membrane to link cytoskeletal proteins in one cell to cytoskeletal proteins in neighboring cells or to proteins in the extracellular matrix.	44	0.0382	2.4E-22	8.25E-21
GO_MITOCHONDRIAL_MATRIX	412	The gel-like material, with considerable fine structure, that lies in the matrix space, or lumen, of a mitochondrion. It contains the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and, in some organisms, the enzymes concerned with fatty acid oxidation.	29	0.0704	4.28E-22	1.39E-20
GO_CELL_BODY	494	The portion of a cell bearing surface projections such as axons, dendrites, cilia, or flagella that includes the nucleus, but excludes all cell projections.	30	0.0607	5.42E-21	1.66E-19
GO_SYNAPSE	754	The junction between a nerve fiber of one neuron and another neuron or muscle fiber or glial cell; the site of interneuronal communication. As the nerve fiber approaches the synapse it enlarges into a specialized structure, the presynaptic nerve ending, which contains mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. At the tip of the nerve ending is the presynaptic membrane; facing it, and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft) is a specialized area of membrane on the receiving cell, known as the postsynaptic membrane. In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic nerve ending secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane.	33	0.0438	1.15E-18	3.36E-17
